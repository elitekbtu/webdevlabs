    <!-- The <div> element is used as a container for other HTML elements.

        The <div> Element
        The <div> element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.
        
        Example
        A <div> element takes up all available width:
        
        Lorem Ipsum <div>I am a div</div> dolor sit amet.
        Result
        Lorem Ipsum
        I am a div
        dolor sit amet.
        
        The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
        
        <div> as a container
        The <div> element is often used to group sections of a web page together. -->
